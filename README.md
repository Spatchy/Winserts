# Welcome to the Winserts Repository
The official Winserts repository for [Winside](https://github.com/spatchy/Winside).

Each Winsert is an applet that can be used through Winside as a sidebar. Usually, this is an existing website remixed with custom CSS and JavaScript.

## Submitting to the Repository
**⚠️ Important: To avoid cloning the entire repository you MUST use the following command. Do not use your IDE or editor's Git GUI.** ⚠️
```console
git clone -b template --single-branch "https://github.com/Spatchy/Winserts.git"
```
This command will instead clone the `template` branch. Once cloned, create a new branch based on `template` named `winsert/<Your_Winsert_Name>`. You can then safely rename the `your-winsert-name` folder, change fields in the `manifest.json` file and make whatever other changes you want.

See the [Winsert Development Guide](https://github.com/Spatchy/Winside/wiki/Winsert-Development-Guide) for information about how to create a Winsert.

## Support and Issues
- For general issues and feature requests, please submit issues to the [Winside issues board](https://github.com/spatchy/Winside/issues)
- For issues with a specific Winsert in the repository, submit an issue on the [Winserts issues board](https://github.com/spatchy/Winserts/issues). **Remember to tag your issue with the name of the Winsert in question.**
- Support is not guarenteed for Winserts from sources outside this repository.
