# Welcome to the Winserts Repository
The official Winserts repository for [Winside](https://github.com/spatchy/Winside).

Each Winsert is an applet that can be used through Winside as a sidebar. Usually, this is an existing website remixed with custom CSS and JavaScript.

### Support and Issues
- For general issues and feature requests, please submit issues to the [Winside issues board](https://github.com/spatchy/Winside/issues)
- For issues with a specific Winsert in the repository, submit an issue on the [Winserts issues board](https://github.com/spatchy/Winserts/issues). **Remember to tag your issue with the name of the Winsert in question.**
- Support is not guarenteed for Winserts from sources outside this repository.

### Contributing
Please read the wiki (coming soon) for guides on creating your own Winserts and submitting them to the repository.
